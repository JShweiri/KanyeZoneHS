# Kanye Zone High Score Bot README

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script to automate the process of sending a high score to the "Kanye Zone" game website. The primary objective is to find integer pairs `(k, t)` that satisfy the equation: 

\[ 50000k + 233t + 50000 = s \]

where:
- `k` represents the number of Kanyes.
- `t` represents normalized game time.
- `s` is the desired score.

The script then encodes this information and sends it to the game server as a high score entry.

## Functions

1. `findSolution(score, num_solutions=1)`: 
   - Finds pairs `(k, t)` for a given score `s` that satisfy the equation.
   - `num_solutions` parameter determines the number of solutions to return.

2. `send_kanye_zone_hs(name, score)`:
   - Encodes the score and related game details.
   - Sends the encoded high score details to the game server.

## Encoding

The script uses predefined "magic numbers" and the XOR operation to encode game details:

   - Score, number of Kanyes, and game time are encoded using `magic_num1` and sent in the request.
   - The `game_id` combines a game ID from the server with the encoded values encoded once more with `magic_num2`.

## Usage

To send a high score to the "Kanye Zone" game:

```python
response = send_kanye_zone_hs("player_name", desired_score)
```

Replace `"player_name"` with the desired player name and `desired_score` with the score you want to send. The server response will be printed.

## Important Notes

- Maximum allowed score value: `9223372036854775807` (64-bit signed integer max)
- Minimum allowed score value: `-9223372036854775808` (64-bit signed integer min)
- The score value can't be `0`.

## Dependencies

- The script requires the `requests` library. You can install it using:

```
pip install requests
```
